# f24
These routines are for a non-standard 24-bit float format. While there is a
standard for `binary16` and `binary32`, there is not one for 24-bit floats.
This does give me some artistic liberties, but I tried to be sensible :)

## Format
The format I went with has 1 bit for the sign and 7 bits for the exponent, and
these are packed into a byte. The significand is 17 bits, but the top bit
is treated as an implicit `1`, and so it is actually encoded as a 16-bit word.

## Special values (0, inf, NaN)
The exponent has a bias of `+63`, or `0b0111111` in binary. `0` is encoded as an
exponent of `-63`, regardless of the significand. `inf` is encoded as `2^64`,
and `NaN` is encoded as `2^64*1.x` where `x` is any non-zero value.

## Example values
Example values:
```

2.16841e-19   0 0000001 0000000000000000  smallest representable positive number

-inf          1 1111111 0000000000000000
NaN           - 1111111 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx some non-zero value so as not to be interpreted as inf
```

## Input/Output
I aimed to keep input/output consistent. Floats are stored in registers `AHL`
and `CDE`, where `A` and `C` hold the sign (top bit) and exponent (bottom bits),
and `HL` and `DE` hold the bottom 16 bits of the significand. `AHL` always holds
the first input (often referred to in these documents as `x`), and `CDE` always
holds the second floating-point input (referred to as `y` in these docs). In all
cases where output is a float, the result is in `AHL`.

There are three "strange" routines:
* `f24rand` has no input
* `f24cmp` takes float inputs, but returns output in the zero flag and carry flag
* `f24div_pow2` takes as second input an unsigned integer in register `B`.

To summarize:
*  AHL is `x`, the first operand (if required)
*  CDE is `y`, the second operand (if required)
*  AHL is the output (if output is a float)


## Routines
These float routines are for the most part prefixed with `f24` to distinguish
them. Most of them are in their own file, but some files contain several
routines. These cases are noted in the chart below.
